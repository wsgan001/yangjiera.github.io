<li><p>While generating the tweets from &ldquo;dev.twitter.com/streaming/reference/get/statuses/sample&rdquo; I have got two types of data: &ldquo;created_at&rdquo; and &ldquo;delete&rdquo; (which contains very less information). Is this correct? And if yes, do we have to filter the &ldquo;delete&rdquo; data or count this as a tweet? (for Question 3, part 1.2) <br /><br />
Answer: It means that the tweet was deleted. See reference here:
<a href="https://dev.twitter.com/streaming/overview/messages-types#status_deletion_notices_delete">status deletion notices delete</a><br />
The perfect way to handle this would be: you delete the previous tweet that the delete message refers to; and also delete the ‘delete message’ itself. But handling this is not the purpose of the exercise. You can pretend that nothing weird happens: just count every message you get as a tweet. Doing this way will not degrade your grade.</p>

<li><p>I used the coordinated of Amsterdam, how can I distinghuish the tweets from schiphol with slightly different coordinated, in python? <br /><br />
Answer: To get the tweets sent from Schiphol, you have two options:<br />
1. use ‘json&rsquo; package to extract the coordinates of each tweets you get from Amsterdam— in real time, or after the completion of data retrieval — check if it is within the bounding box of Schiphol. <br />
2. change the coordinates parameter of your program to Schiphol coordinates, and run it again.<br />
I guess option 2 is easier. option 1 would be encouraged, but not required.</p>

<li><p>I didn't managed to make python import the pandas and the plotlibrary: I installed everythin as requisted 32 bit and 2.7 according to my new python version, and I opened python in cmd directory. But still the lines you showed in figure 1 didn't work for me. I gives something like, no module named numpy.<br /><br />
Answer: You need to install packages numpy. To this end, you can use pip, or installation packages from <a href="http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/">here</a>(particularly for windows) to install numpy. For the latter (windows) you need to add Python to windows registry before executing the binary installation program by doing something like <a href="http://stackoverflow.com\\/questions\\/3652625\\/installing-setuptools-on-64-bit-windows/9131949#9131949">this</a>. <br /></p>
